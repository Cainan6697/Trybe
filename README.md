This repository contains two folders, both created while studying at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).
The *course-summaries* folder contains home-made compiled lessons, so they can be consulted by peer students, whereas the *exercises* folder displays all the developed learning activities.

The Trybe program has more than **1,500 hours** of classroom and online classes and covers front-end, back-end, computer science, software engineering, agile methodologies, and soft skills.
